### Color Palette
Clearly list primary and secondary colors with their hex codes, RGB, and CMYK values. This will ensure consistency in branding.

## 3. UI Components
### Buttons
Define button sizes, colors, hover effects, and typography.

Style the numbers, arrows, and the “...” symbol when there are more pages.

## 4. Graphics & Icons
Specify the design and size guidelines for creating consistent icons and other graphics. If you're using a specific icon set, reference it here.

- Recommendations for alt text and captions

## 6. Spacing & Layout
Use a grid system or define specific margins and paddings to ensure consistent spacing across all pages and components.

## 7. Interaction & Motion

## 9. Accessibility
Provide guidelines to ensure that your web application is accessible to everyone, including users with disabilities. This might include color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation guidelines, and more.

## 10. Code Standards
If your guide is also intended for developers, provide coding conventions, naming conventions, and other technical standards.

## 11. Version History
Keep track of the updates and changes made to the style guide. This helps team members know when new guidelines have been added or existing ones have been modified.

## 12. Feedback Loop
